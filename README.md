# Dynamic Pricing

<!-- 概要：講說不一定的點在哪 -->
<!-- 使用兩階段 stochastic dynamic Programming 規劃訂貨量和每一期的定價，並以 Arima 和 regreession 作為需求估計方法。 -->
Pricing is an important problem, and there are various methodologies. 
In this research, we try to find order quantity and following pricing stategies. 
The methodogies includes demand forecasting and dynamic programming.

Keywords: Dynamic Programming (Policy and Value Iteration), Time series,, etc.

## Table of Contents

## Background and Motivation
<!-- Describe the motivation, background, or problem definition (you may refer to the lecture notes in ORA course). -->

## Methodology
<!-- (1) write a tutorial to introduce the topic/methodology theoretically and mathematically. (2) clarify the assumptions, limitations, applicable conditions, pros, or cons of the topic/methodology you introduced. -->

### Demand Forecasting

### Two-stage Stochastic Dynamic Programming
In first stage, we determine the Order Quantity. In next stage, we use Stochastic Dynamic Programming to find the expected revenue.


### Example and Applications
<!-- give a small and understandable example for python illustration. The example could include dataset, define variables, introduce solver, set up experiments, clarify the numerical analysis result, or provide some managerial implications. -->
